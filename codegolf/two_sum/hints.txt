List comprehensions will carry you a long way here. Just as a refresher

out = []
for element in iterable:
    output.append(element + 5)

-can be represented as a list comprehension by:

out = [element + 5 for element in iterable]

Also worth noting is the `enumerate` function, which will return each element in a tuple with its index. So

names = ["foo", "bar"]
indices = enumerate(names)
print(list(indices))
# prints `[(0, 'foo'), (1, 'bar')]`

This can be used in a for loop (or list comprehension) as such:

for idx, name in enumerate(names):
	print(name + " is at: " + idx)
